    Hello! I am a Mathematics PhD student at the University of Texas Austin. 
    Previously I studied at <a href="https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/">Queens' College, Cambridge</a> where I did my undergraduate and masters'.

    My research interests are in topology and geometry broadly. Here is my <a href="assets\Justin Chen Math CV.pdf">CV</a>.
